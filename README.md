# What is this place?

I'm an Engineer with a bit of experience with computers. I feel at home with Open Source and solving difficult problems, by getting deep into the details. I'm originally from [Chile](https://www.chile.travel/) which is a beautiful country, but decided to move to [Ireland](https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-guinness-1328737), which is even more beautiful... but colder!

I studied Civil Engineering (with a small grasp of computers) in Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso, and Computer Programming at Federico Santa Maria University.

# How it started

I started my career by building a Point of Sale system for a [small coffee](https://xurros.com) in Chile. They have grown to around ~15 branches, and they **still use the software I wrote**. This C++ code I wrote (based on GNU/Linux and Qt) is still working after almost 20 years!

After this endeavor I went back to finish University and then I joined Tubaloo, a new start-up in Chile that wanted to seamlessly connect traditional telephone landlines and VoIP. We achieved this by negotiating with [Tuvalu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuvalu), a beautiful island in the South Pacific, to allocate part of their telephone numbering to us. Every Tubaloo client would get a _Tuvalu_ local phone number! We actually did it, but because of some _external_ problems we had to leave it before we could make it profitable.

# How it is going

After a bit of time I got a job offer from Dublin, Ireland. We decided to move here with my partner Alicia, and my 2 children. Here (workwise) I've been involved in Infrastructure things, and having to manage lots of CPU and RAM resources. I've been building [Kubernetes](https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes-operator) [Operators](https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes) for MongoDB and a few other things that I've managed to Open Source.

# Things I've done (with Computers)

I've built a few things the last couple of years:

- [kubeobject](https://github.com/mongodb/kubeobject): An ORM-like Python library to manipulate Kubernetes's Custom Resources.
- [sonar](https://github.com/mongodb/sonar): Allows you to easily produce, template, build and publish Dockerfiles and Docker images. It uses a declarative, multi-stage approach to build Docker images.
- [hake](https://gitlab.com/licorna/hake): _Kubernetes clusters with no bone_. A simple tool (in Rust) to easily deploy and recreate Kubernetes clusters using Kind or DigitalOcean's Kubernetes offering. I've been using this for the last year as my main CLI for all things related to testing in Kubernetes.

# Things I enjoy doing

- I love music, playing the [traverse flute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_flute) and singing.
- I really enjoy reading about history, novels and [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Hern%C3%A1ndez). Actually anything. I have beside my bed: [Brian Green's Until The End of Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43685238-until-the-end-of-time), [Schrodinger's What is Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Life%3F), [Wolf's Proust and the Squid](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/289751.Proust_and_the_Squid), and a few others. They change every few weeks.
- Playing football; however, I'm not a great player for a guy from South America.
- Cycling, dropping the children at school, cycling to work and back. Great exercise!
